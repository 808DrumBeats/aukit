Documentation
=============

Audio Kit is heavily documented using standard practices that result in Xcode-style documentation within pop-overs and sidebars.  Additionally, a web-based class reference document and a DocSet that can be installed into your '~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/' folder are availabe at <http://audiokit.io/docs/>.
