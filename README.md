Objective-Csound
================

Obective-Csound (OCS for short, pronounced "ox"), is an Objective-C wrapper
for Csound or more specifically, Csound-for-iOS.  

### Installation

The repository includes the ExampleProject which you should be able to open
with Xcode and run on your iPad or the iOS simulator.

In order to install the documentation and Xcode quick help, you need to 
install appdoc.  More information about this in the developer's guide doc.

### Contribute!

We encourage you to fork Objective-Csound and contribute one of the many 
opcodes we have yet to implement or to install your own User-Defined Opcode
in Opcodes/UDOs.  

More information on contribution is available on the wiki:
