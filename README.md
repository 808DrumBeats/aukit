Objective-C Sound
=================

Obective-C Sound (OCS for short, pronounced "ox"), is an Objective-C API 
for sound design applications ranging from sound synthesis, real time effects
processing, and audio analysis.  It works on all OSX and iOS based devices, 
ie. Macs and iPads.

### Installation

The repository includes the "Objective-C Sound" Xcode workspace file which will 
open in Xcode with a few example projects demonstrating building a project
for the Mac or for the iPad or iOS Simulator.  

The Mac version requires installation of CsoundLib64 which can be installed
using the universal installer available at

https://sourceforge.net/projects/csound/

In order to install the Xcode-based documentation and Xcode quick help, you need 
to install appdoc.  More information about this in the developer's guide doc.

### Contribute!

We encourage you to fork Objective-C Sound and contribute one of the many 
opcodes we have yet to implement or to install your own User-Defined Operation
in Operations/UDOs.  

More information on contribution is available on the wiki:
