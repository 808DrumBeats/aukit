AudioKit
========

AudioKit is a powerful audio toolkit for synthesizing, processing, and analyzing sounds.  It contains several examples for iOS (iPhone & iPad) and Mac OSX, written in both Objective-C and in Swift.  A test suite is provided for many of the operations included in AudioKit.  A playground project can be used for trying out AudioKit instruments and for greatly speeding up the development of your own instruments and applications.
