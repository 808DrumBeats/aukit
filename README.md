AudioKit
========

AudioKit is an API for sound design applications ranging from sound synthesis, 
real time effects processing, and audio analysis.  It works on all OSX and iOS 
based devices, ie. Macs, iPads and iPhones.

### Installation

The repository includes the AudioKit Xcode workspace file which will 
open in Xcode with a few example projects demonstrating building a project
for the Mac or for the iPad or iOS Simulator.  

### About Us

AudioKit was initially conceived by Aurelius Prochazka and Adam Boulanger
and primarily programmed by Aurelius Prochazka.
