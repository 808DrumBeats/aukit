opcode: barmodel
operation: OCSStruckMetalBar
operationClass: OCSAudio
summary:  Creates a tone similar to a struck metal bar.
description:
  Audio output is a tone similar to a struck metal bar, using a physical model developed from solving the partial differential equation. 
  There are controls over the boundary conditions as well as the bar characteristics.
input_list: kbcL, kbcR, iK, ib, kscan, iT30, ipos, ivel, iwid, iwid
required_inputs:
- [iT30, decayTime, 30 db decay time in seconds.]
- [iK, dimensionlessStiffness, Dimensionless stiffness parameter. If this parameter is negative then the initialization is skipped and the previous state of the bar is continued.]
- [ib, highFrequencyLoss, high-frequency loss parameter (keep this small).]
- [ipos, strikePosition, Position along the bar that the strike occurs.]
- [ivel, strikeVelocity, Normalized strike velocity.]
- [iwid, strikeWidth, Spatial width of strike.]
- [kbcL, leftBoundaryCondition, Boundary condition at left end of bar (1 is clamped; 2 pivoting and 3 free).]
- [kbcR, rightBoundaryCondition, Boundary condition at right end of bar (1 is clamped; 2 pivoting and 3 free).]
- [kscan, scanSpeed, Speed of scanning the output location.]
