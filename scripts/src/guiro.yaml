opcode: guiro
operation: OCSGuiro
operationClass: OCSAudio
summary:  Semi-physical model of a guiro sound.
description:
  This is one of the PhISEM percussion opcodes. PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event Modeling) 
  is an algorithmic approach for simulating collisions of multiple independent sound producing objects.
input_list: kamp, idettack, inum, idamp, imaxshake, ifreq, ifreq1
required_inputs:
- [idettack, maximumDuration, Period of time over which all sound is stopped]
- [kamp, amplitude, Amplitude of output. Since these instruments are stochastic this is only an approximation.]

optional_inputs:
- [inum, count, The number of beads, teeth, bells, timbrels, etc. If zero, the default value is 128.]
- [imaxshake, energyReturn, Amount of energy to add back into the system. The value should be in range 0 to 1.]
- [ifreq, mainResonantFrequency, The main resonant frequency. The default value is 2500.]
- [ifreq1, firstResonantFrequency, The first resonant frequency. The default value is 4000.]
