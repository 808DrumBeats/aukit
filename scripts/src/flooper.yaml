opcode: flooper

operation: OCSFTablelooper

operationClass: OCSAudio

summary: Function-table-based crossfading looper.

description:
 This opcode reads audio from a function table and plays it back in a loop with user-defined start time, duration and crossfade time. 
 It also allows the pitch of the loop to be controlled, including reversed playback. It accepts non-power-of-two tables, such as deferred-allocation GEN01 tables.
