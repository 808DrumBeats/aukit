summary:  Semi-physical model of a crunch sound.
description:
  This one of the PhISEM percussion opcodes. PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event Modeling) 
  is an algorithmic approach for simulating collisions of multiple independent sound producing objects.
input_list: iamp, idettack, inum, idamp, imaxshake
required_inputs:
- [idettack, maximumDuration, Period of time over which all sound is stopped.]
- [iamp, amplitude,  Amplitude of output. As these instruments are stochastic this is only a approximation.]

optional_inputs:
- [inum, count, The number of beads, teeth, bells, timbrels, etc. The default value is 7.]
- [idamp, dampingFactor, The damping factor as part of this equation "damping = 0.998 + (dampingFactor * 0.002)" The default damping is 0.99806 which means that the default value of dampingFactor is 0.03. The maximum damping is 1.0 (no damping). This means the maximum value for dampingFactor is 1.0. The recommended range for dampingFactor is usually below 75% of the maximum value.]
- [imaxshake, energyReturn, Amount of energy to add back into the system. The value should be in range 0 to 1.]
