opcode: balance

operation: AKBalance

operationClass: AKAudio

summary: Adjusts one audio signal according to the values of another.

description:
  This operation outputs a version of the audio source, amplitude-modified 
  so that its rms power is equal to that of the comparator audio source. 
  Thus a signal that has suffered loss of power (eg., in passing through a filter bank)
  can be restored by matching it with, for instance, its own source. It should be noted 
  that this modifies amplitude only; output signal is not altered in any other respect.
