opcode: phasor

operation: OCSPhasor

operationClass: OCSAudio

summary:  A normalized moving phase value.

description:
  An internal phase is successively accumulated in accordance with the frequency to produce a moving phase value, normalized to lie in the range 0 <= phase < 1.
 
  When used as the index to a table unit, this phase (multiplied by the desired function table length) will cause it to behave like an oscillator.
 
  Note that phasor is a special kind of integrator, accumulating phase increments that represent frequency settings.
