opcode: oscili

operation: AKOscillator

operationClass: AKAudio

summary: A simple oscillator with linear interpolation.

description:
 Reads from the function table sequentially and repeatedly at given frequency.
 Linear interpolation is applied for table look up from internal phase values.

input_list: xamp, xcps, ifn, iphs

required_inputs:

- ifn: {
	audioKitName: fTable, 
	comment: "Requires a wrap-around guard point"
}
- xcps: {
	audioKitName: frequency, 
	comment: "Frequency in cycles per second"
}
- xamp: {
	audioKitName: amplitude, 
	comment: "Amplitude of the output"
}


optional_inputs:
- iphs: {
	audioKitName: phase, 
	comment: "Initial phase of sampling, expressed as a fraction of a cycle (0 to 1). A negative value will cause phase initialization to be skipped. The default value is 0.",
	default: 0
