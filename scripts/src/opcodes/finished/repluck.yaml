opcode: repluck

operation: OCSPluckedString

operationClass: OCSAudio

summary:  Physical model of the plucked string.

description:
  A user can control the pluck point, the pickup point, the filter, and an additional audio signal used to excite the 'string'. 
  Based on the Karplus-Strong algorithm.

required_inputs:
- icps: {
	ocsVar: frequency, 
	comment: "Frequency of the string"
}
- iplk: {
	ocsVar: pluckPosition, 
	comment: " The point of pluck as a fraction of the way up the string (0 to 1). A pluck point of zero means no initial pluck."
}
- kamp: {
	ocsVar: amplitude, 
	comment: "Amplitude of note."
}
- kpick: {
	ocsVar: samplePosition, 
	comment: " Proportion of the way along the string to sample the output."
}
- krefl: {
	ocsVar: reflectionCoefficient, 
	comment: "The coefficient of reflection, indicating the lossiness and the rate of decay. It must be strictly between 0 and 1 (it will complain about both 0 and 1)."
}
- axcite: {
	ocsVar: excitationSignal, 
	comment: "A signal which excites the string."
