required_inputs:
- icps: {
	audioKitName: frequency, 
	comment: "Frequency of the string"
}
- iplk: {
	audioKitName: pluckPosition, 
	comment: " The point of pluck as a fraction of the way up the string (0 to 1). A pluck point of zero means no initial pluck."
}
- kamp: {
	audioKitName: amplitude, 
	comment: "Amplitude of note."
}
- kpick: {
	audioKitName: samplePosition, 
	comment: " Proportion of the way along the string to sample the output."
}
- krefl: {
	audioKitName: reflectionCoefficient, 
	comment: "The coefficient of reflection, indicating the lossiness and the rate of decay. It must be strictly between 0 and 1 (it will complain about both 0 and 1)."
}
- axcite: {
	audioKitName: excitationSignal, 
	comment: "A signal which excites the string."
