operation: AKGuiro

operationClass: AKAudio

summary:  Semi-physical model of a guiro sound.

description:
  This is one of the PhISEM percussion opcodes. PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event Modeling) 
  is an algorithmic approach for simulating collisions of multiple independent sound producing objects.

input_list: kamp, idettack, inum, 0, imaxshake, ifreq, ifreq1

required_inputs:

- idettack: {
	audioKitName: maximumDuration, 
	comment: "Period of time over which all sound is stopped"
}
- kamp: {
