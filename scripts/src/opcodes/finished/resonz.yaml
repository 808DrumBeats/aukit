operation: AKVariableFrequencyResponseBandPassFilter

operationClass: AKAudio

summary:  A second-order resonant filter.

description:
  This is a second-order filter defined by a center frequency which is the frequency position of 
  the peak response, and a bandwidth which is the frequency difference between the upper and lower half-power points.
