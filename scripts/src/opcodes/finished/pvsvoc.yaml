opcode: pvsvoc

operation: OCSSpectralVocoder

operationClass: OCSFSignal

summary:  Combine the spectral envelope of one F-signal with the excitation (frequencies) of another.

description:
  This operation provides support for cross-synthesis of amplitudes and frequencies. It takes the 
  amplitudes of one input F-signal and combines with frequencies from another. 
  It is a spectral version of the well-known channel vocoder.

required_inputs:

- famp: {
	ocsVar: amplitudeFSignal, 
	comment: "Input phase vocoder stream from which the amplitudes will be extracted."

	comment: "Input phase vocoder stream from which the frequencies will be taken."
}
- kdepth: {
	ocsVar: depth, 
	comment: "Depth of effect, affecting how much of the frequencies will be taken from the second fsig: 0, the output is amplitudeFSignal, 1 the output is the amplitudeFSignal amplitudes and excitationFrequenciesFSignal frequencies."

	comment: "Boost or attenuation applied to the output"
}
