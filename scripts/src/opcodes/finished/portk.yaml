summary:  Applies portamento to a step-valued control signal.

description:
  applies portamento to a step-valued control signal. At each new step value, 
  the output is low-pass filtered to move towards that value at a rate determined by halfTime. 
  halfTime is the “half-time” of the function (in seconds), during which the curve will 
  traverse half the distance towards the new value, then half as much again, etc., 
  theoretically never reaching its asymptote.
