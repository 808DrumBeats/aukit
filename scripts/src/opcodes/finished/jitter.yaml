opcode: jitter

operation: OCSJitter

operationClass: OCSControl

summary:  Generates a segmented line whose segments are randomly generated.

description:
  This operation generates a segmented line whose segments are randomly generated inside the interval amplitude to -amplitude. 
  Duration of each segment is a random value generated according to minimum and maximum frequency values.

  This can be used to make more natural and “analog-sounding” some static, dull sound. 
  For best results, it is suggested to keep its amplitude moderate.
