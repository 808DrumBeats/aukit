description:
  A fast and robust method for approximating sound propagation, achieving convincing Doppler shifts without having to solve equations. The method computes frequency shifts based on reading an input delay line at a delay time computed from the distance between source and mic and the speed of sound. One instance of the opcode is required for each dimension of space through which the sound source moves. If the source sound moves at a constant speed from in front of the microphone, through the microphone, to behind the microphone, then the output will be frequency shifted above the source frequency at a constant frequency while the source approaches, then discontinuously will be shifted below the source frequency at a constant frequency as the source recedes from the microphone. If the source sound moves at a constant speed through a point to one side of the microphone, then the rate of change of position will not be constant, and the familiar Doppler frequency shift typical of a siren or engine approaching and receding along a road beside a listener will be heard.
