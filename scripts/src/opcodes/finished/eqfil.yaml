summary: Second-order tunable equalisation filter based on Regalia and Mitra design.

description:
  Provides a peak/notch filter for building parametric/graphic equalisers.

  The amplitude response for this filter will be flat (=1) for gain=1. 
  With gain bigger than 1, there will be a peak at the center frequency, 
  whose width is given by the bandwidth parameter, but outside this band, the 
  response will tend towards 1. Conversely, if gain is smaller than 1, 
  a notch will be created around the CF.
