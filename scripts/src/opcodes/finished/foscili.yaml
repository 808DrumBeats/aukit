operationClass: OCSAudio
summary:  Basic frequency modulated oscillator with linear interpolation.
description:
  Interpolating generators will produce a noticeably cleaner output signal, but
  they may take as much as twice as long to run. Adequate accuracy can also be
  gained without the time cost of interpolation by using large stored function
  tables of 2K, 4K or 8K points if the space is available.  
input_list: xamp, kcps, xcar, xmod, kndx, ifn, iphs
required_inputs:
- [ifn, fTable, Function table to use.  Requires a wrap-around guard point.]
- [kcps, baseFrequency, In cycles per second, or Hz, this is the common denominator for the carrier and modulating frequencies.]
- [xcar, carrierMultiplier, This multiplied by the baseFrequency gives the carrier frequency.]
- [xmod, modulatingMultiplier, This multiplied by the baseFrequency gives the modulating frequency.]
- [kndx, modulationIndex, This multiplied by the modulating frequency gives the modulation amplitude.]
- [xamp, amplitude, The amplitude of the output signal]

optional_inputs:
- [iphs, phase, Initial phase of waveform in fTable, expressed as a fraction of a cycle (0 to 1).]
