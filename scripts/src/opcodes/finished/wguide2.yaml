summary: A model of beaten plate consisting of two parallel delay-lines and two first-order lowpass filters.

description:
  This  is a model of beaten plate consisting of two parallel delay-lines and two first-order lowpass filters. The two feedback lines are mixed and sent to the delay again each cycle.
