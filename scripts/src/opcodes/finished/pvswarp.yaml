input_list: fsigin, kscal, kshift, klowest, kmeth, kgain, kcoefs

required_inputs:

- fsigin: {
	audioKitName: sourceSignal, 
	comment: "Input Stream"
}
- kscal: {
	audioKitName: scalingRatio, 
	comment: "Spectral envelope scaling ratio. Values > 1 stretch the envelope and < 1 compress it."
}
- kshift: {
	audioKitName: shift, 
	comment: "Spectral envelope shift, values > 0 shift the envelope linearly upwards and values < 1 shift it downwards."
}

optional_inputs:
- klowest: {
	audioKitName: lowFrequency, 
	comment: "Lowest frequency shifted, defaults to zero.",
	default: 0
}
- kmeth: {
	audioKitName: extractionMethod, 
	comment: "Spectral envelope extraction method 1: liftered cepstrum method (default); 2: true envelope method (defaults to 1).",
	default: 1
}
- kgain: {
	audioKitName: gain, 
	comment: "Amplitude Scaling (defaults to 1)",
	default: 1
}
- kcoefs: {
	audioKitName: numberOfCoefficients, 
	comment: "Number of cepstrum coefs used in formant preservation (defaults to 80).",
	default: 80
