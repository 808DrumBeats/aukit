Audio Kit Examples
==================

This folder contains examples of simple mini-projects for both iOS devices and on the Mac (OS X).  There are examples in Objective-C as well as Swift.

Examples for both iOS and OSX (Mac)
-----------------------------------

* Continuous Control - demonstrates using instrument properties to alter a drone sound as well as synchronizing user interface elements to those properties

* Convolution - demonstrating the convolving operations

* Demo Instruments - a couple of instruments that use math inside of operation parameters

* Global Effects - shows how an instrument can be added to the end of an audio chain to affect multiple instruments at once, in this example as a reverb application

* Play Audio File - shows how to include and reference an audio file which can be played at various speeds through a note property

* Sequences - has three similar methods of creating a series of notes via creating separate note, altering note properties, and updating instrument properties.


iOS-only Examples
------------------

* Granular Synthesis - a demonstration of simple granular synthesis techniques

* Harmonizer - utilization of the microphone and pitch shifting

* Song Library Player - interface to the iOS music library and processing of songs

* Swift FM Oscillator - synthesis using frequency modulation techniques in Swift

* Swift Granular Synthesis - Granular Synthesis example in Swift

* Swift Harmonizer - Harmonizer example written in Swift

* Touch Regions - an FM Oscillator with two touch regions that control various parameters
