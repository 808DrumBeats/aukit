NOTES
=====

* LOVING assignable maximum and minimum values for instant remapping of slider ranges
* LOVING ui elements that change multiple parameters!!!!

TO DO
=====

* Make Convolution work
* Write an audio processor that outputs something to Objective-C
* Rewrite OCSWindowsTable with separate methods for each type since Gause and Kaiser take another parameter.
* Get Adam's opinion on the two methods inside Simple FM example.

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE
============================

* Rewrite Github readme as if we were already open-sourced.
* Make sure the opcode functionalities are complete, or else make a todo note in the docs.
* Improve examples without making them hard to understand.  More information and control in the .xibs.

MAJOR UPGRADES
==============

* OCSMidi - Do MIDI right.
* OCSSequence - Sequencing a la CCSequence to manage timed note events

ALWAYS MORE
===========

* More opcode documentation - utilize Iain McCurdy's insights on various opcodes as well
* More documentation, both as comments and in the documentation folder
* More Opcodes - Fof
* More Function Tables
* More UDOs
* More Examples - PluckDrum & PluckString
